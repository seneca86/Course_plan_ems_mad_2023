# Economic Modelling and Simulation
## Lesson 0: Organization of the course

Please regard this document as an update on the Syllabus and the source of truth in the cases they differ.

### Homework rules

* Homework will be done *in groups* of 3 or 4 students: only one student in the group will submit the code and will indicate the members of the group at the beginning of the solution
* You need to register these groups into Blackboard; the groups will not change throughout the course
* Please *do not* submit several versions within the same group: if you do that I will grade one at random (because I have no way to know which is the correct one)
* Submission will be done via `Replit` (see below); submissions through other platforms will *not* be accepted
* It is critical that the code runs in `Replit`, otherwise you will get 50% of the grade at most; justifications such as "it ran in my computer / in platform X (but does not run in `Replit`" will not be accepted

### Tools

Python is one of the most popular programming languages and is therefore available in most general-purpose IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).

We will use [Replit](www.replit.com) for homework and exam submissions; for the classes I recommend that you use VSCode or GitHub codespaces, but you have other alternatives if you prefer:

- [VSCode web version](https://vscode.dev/)
- [VSCode desktop version](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)

These are all valid alternatives, each with merits on its own, although the recommendation is to stick to Replit and VSCode for practical purposes.

In case you want to install a desktop-based IDE, you will need to install Python itself first. You may download it from the [following link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Bibliography

Luckily enough, there are excellent Python books out there. We will borrow heavily from them, so credit is due, particularly to the following ones:
- _Introducing Python_, (O'Reilly), Bill Lubanovic
- _Python for data analysis_ (O'Reilly), Wes McKinney
- _Think Bayes_, (O'Reilly), Allen B. Downey
- _Think Stats_, (O'Reilly), Allen B. Downey
- _Practical Time Series Analysis_, (O'Reilly), Aileen Nielsen
Also, I encourage you to check the [Python official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
