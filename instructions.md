### Tools

Python is one of the most popular programming languages and is therefore available in most general-purpose IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).

We will use [Replit](www.replit.com) for homework and exam submissions; for the classes I recommend that you use VSCode or GitHub codespaces, but you have other alternatives if you prefer:

- [VSCode web version](https://vscode.dev/)
- [VSCode desktop version](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)

These are all valid alternatives, each with merits on its own, although the recommendation is to stick to Replit and VSCode for practical purposes.

In case you want to install a desktop-based IDE, you will need to install Python itself first. You may download it from the [following link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Bibliography

Luckily enough, there are excellent Python books out there. We will borrow heavily from them, so credit is due, particularly to the following ones:
- _Introducing Python_, (O'Reilly), Bill Lubanovic
- _Python for data analysis_ (O'Reilly), Wes McKinney
- _Think Bayes_, (O'Reilly), Allen B. Downey
- _Think Stats_, (O'Reilly), Allen B. Downey
- _Practical Time Series Analysis_, (O'Reilly), Aileen Nielsen
Also, I encourage you to check the [Python official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
